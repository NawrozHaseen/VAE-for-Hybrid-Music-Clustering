# VAE-for-Hybrid-Music-Clustering
This project aims to perform hybrid music clustering using Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and other clustering techniques like KMeans, Agglomerative, and DBSCAN. The pipeline processes audio and lyrics data, extracts features, trains models, and evaluates the results.
