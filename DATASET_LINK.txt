Due to file size limitations, the dataset and report are hosted on Google Drive. Files (fma_dataset_small and fma_metadata) can be unzipped and looked through. They contain Free Music Archive's music file samples and their respective metadata.

NOTE: You don't need to download the dataset, just run the script 00_download_fma_small.py and it will begin downloading.
